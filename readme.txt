Complement to know how many times a Post has been seen

== Description ==
With this plugin, you can easily see how many people have viewed a Post

It only runs on Posts and after some time has passed through an Endpoint, so it doesn't affect CWV, and the page loads quickly.

The post meta that we store the value in is "views".

More information in Spanish about the plugin in the link [Show the most viewed Articles, without affecting the loading speed](https://www.bubuku.com/mostrar-articulos-mas-vistos-sin-que-afecte-velocidad-de-carga/)

== Installation ==
